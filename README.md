OpenSkyscraper
==============

OpenSkyscraper is a versatile, Open Source tower simulation game inspired by the "SimTower" and "YootTower" games of the late 90s.


Variants
--------

The idea behind OpenSkyscraper is to build a versatile tower simulation with a robust engine under the hood. Supported by this foundation it should be possible to develop an entertaining, challenging and fun game.

In order to satisfy both SimTower veterans and newbies I suggest the development of two separate game logic trees, i.e. variants of the game:

- Classic
- Deluxe

*The definitive variant names are yet to be decided upon*


### Classic

The *Classic* variant's dedication is to mimic and replicate the original SimTower and/or YootTower as good as possible.


### Deluxe

The *Deluxe* variant should use the original game as a basis and grow and develop from there. Incorporating new facilities or leveraging new gameplay possibilities is what this variant is all about.

SimTower is a neat game but its game mechanics and possibilities are very limited. Yet it has the potential to be massively extended into a very rich and challenging piece of entertainment.
