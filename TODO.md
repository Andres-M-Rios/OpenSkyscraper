OpenSkyscraper TODO
===================

- Change `Texture` class to use _DevIL_ to read textures. `Bitmap` class might become superfluous.
- Create `Entity` class for building simple hierarchies
- Create `Sprite` class based on `Entity` to draw textured rectangles. *Maybe some powerful C-functions would be sufficient for our drawing purposes. Creating some custom drawing code for each item is a bit easier than updating the sprite state all the time.*
